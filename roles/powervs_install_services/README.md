### Enabling Services

This module is same for both SLES and RHEL.

This role performs the following tasks:
- Installs **SQUID** package, and configures squid.conf file as described in this link https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-set-full-Linux

- Installs **NTP** packages and updates named.conf file as per the requirement.

This role will also **start and enable** all above mentioned services.

Additionally it will also install **awscli** package. awscli should be configured manually later.

```
server_config: {
squid: { enable: false },

dns: { enable: false, dns_servers: "161.26.0.7; 161.26.0.8; 9.9.9.9;" },
awscli: { enable: false }
}
```
